 - make a map for all error messages
 - use chaining for logs
 - make API more declarative
 - setup a routes map?
 - refactor source code - follow code style present in mongo.go
 - improve response functions
 - use interfaces
 - share dependencies?
 - response JSON's -> perhaps split into 2 separate functions for success and failure
 - better abstraction for mapping the routes
 - stop printing logs to console -> write to file(s)
